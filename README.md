simplicity-mbk
==============

This is the source of the Pebble watchface "Simplicity MBK". It is based on the SDK Example "Simplicity" with the following additions:
* Status of Bluetooth connections (vibrates on connect and disconnect)
* Battery stats
* Day/Night mode, configurable via Pebble app
* Shows the logo of Masala Brass Kollektiv (MBK) in the background
* Shows the time till next show of MBK right next to the trumpet

This watchface was created to play around with the Pebble SDK and should give you a nice starting point for your own watchfaces.
